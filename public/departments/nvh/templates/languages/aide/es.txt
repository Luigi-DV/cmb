The <i> Only Team Projects </i> option allows you to view only projects that are covered by at least one person on the same team as this user. You can not define a specific list of projects for this right, just add at least one task on a new project so that everyone on the same team can access this project. The <i> Only projects owned or assigned </i> option allows you to see all the tasks of the projects owned by the user, as well as the tasks on which it is assigned. The <i> Only Tasks assigned to it </i> option allows you to restrict the display to its own tasks only.
